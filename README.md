# Deobfuscated BrickerBot

This code is a deobfuscation of some BrickerBot code, as released by its purported author. It is available [here](https://ghostbin.com/paste/o6553).

My writeup on it is [here](https://nyoshimizu.github.io/blog/2018/08/10/Deobfuscating-BrickerBot).

## Disclaimer

This code was deobfuscated directly from the code purportedly released by janit0r in obfuscated form. The code is not the complete malware. It also calls some functions and variables that are not declared in the code. I've also removed a significant portion of the payloads, including only enough to indicate coding style and flavor of payloads. In brief, the code here is functionally the same as the obfuscated code released by janit0r, then significantly weakened. I've also modified some payloads to, presumably, be nonfunctional.

Standard warning applies that this code is not meant to nor written up to be used as malware, but for analysis.
